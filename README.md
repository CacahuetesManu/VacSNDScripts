# WIP

Files that work:

## Item trading
1. `Post Moogle.lua` is the supplying part of the item trading duo script, has configurable options and can be configured easily using `Post Moogle CharListGen.lua`.
2. `Kupo Box.lua` is the receiving part of the item trading duo script, has configurable options and can be configured easily using `Kupo Box CharListGen.lua`.

Both of these allow for quickly transferring items between two or more characters.

## GC Provision Supply
1. `Auto Gen Provisioning List.lua` compiles all required GC provision supply items into a file to further be used with other scripts.
2. `Generate list of items to gather.lua` converts the list generated by the previous script into a `list_to_gather.txt` file to display what items each character needs for that day.
3. `Trade GC items to alts.lua` is the GC version of the supplying item trading script, it should be used in conjunction with `Kupo Box.lua` to give the items to the alt character.
4. `Deliver GC Items.lua` delivers the items to the GC automatically, has configurable options.

These scripts allow you to easily level up DoL jobs, and at scale.

### All files use `vac_functions.lua`, `vac_lists.lua` and `vac_char_list.lua`.

Required plugins: AutoRetainer, Teleporter, Lifestream, TextAdvance, Something Need Doing (Expanded Edition), Pandora's Box, vnavmesh
